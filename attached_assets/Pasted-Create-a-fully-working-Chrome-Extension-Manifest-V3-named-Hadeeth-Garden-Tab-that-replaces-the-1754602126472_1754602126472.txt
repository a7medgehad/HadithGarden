Create a fully working Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) named **Hadeeth Garden Tab** that replaces the New Tab page in Chrome.

📌 Source: https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin

### Functionality
1. On each new tab, display **the next hadith in sequence** from *Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn* (English + Arabic if available) instead of random selection.
2. Keep track of the current index using `chrome.storage.local`, so that when the user opens the next tab it moves to the next hadith.  
   - When the end of the collection is reached, wrap back to the start.
3. Pull hadith text from a local JSON cache preloaded in the extension (to avoid heavy requests to sunnah.com).
4. Provide a button in the top-right to "Next Hadith" manually.
5. Include a "Reset to First Hadith" option in settings.

### UI / Design
- Elegant Islamic “garden” theme with soft green tones and subtle geometric patterns.
- Centered card layout with:
  - Arabic text at the top (RTL) in "Amiri" font.
  - English translation below (LTR) in "Inter" or system font.
  - Book and Hadith number shown as small decorative chips.
- Title at the top: “🌿 Garden Tab – Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn”
- Bottom toolbar:  
  - 📖 “View on sunnah.com” button (opens in new tab to exact hadith page).
  - ⭐ “Add to Favorites” button.
  - ⚙️ “Settings” button.

### Settings Page
- Toggle Arabic / English / Both.
- Font size slider.
- Theme: Light / Dark / Auto (system theme).
- Reset reading sequence.
- Export / Import favorites.

### Technical Details
- Manifest V3.
- Files:
  - manifest.json
  - newtab.html / newtab.js / newtab.css
  - options.html / options.js / options.css
  - data/riyadussalihin.json (preloaded hadith data in correct order with fields: `id`, `book`, `number`, `arabic`, `english`, `url`)
  - icons/ (128x128, 48x48, 16x16 PNGs)
- Store:
  - `currentIndex` (int) in chrome.storage.local.
  - `favorites` (array of hadith ids).
- On startup: load currentIndex, display that hadith, increment index after display.
- Smooth fade-in animation for text (respect prefers-reduced-motion).
- Fully responsive for all screen sizes.

### Performance & Privacy
- No analytics, trackers, or remote calls.
- Lazy load fonts if not installed locally.
- Optimized for fast load time.

### Deliverables
- Complete working Chrome extension folder.
- Ready-to-zip for loading into Chrome (Load unpacked → test).
- README with:
  - How to install and load unpacked.
  - How to add more hadith to `riyadussalihin.json`.
  - Attribution: “Hadith content from sunnah.com – used for personal educational purposes.”

⚠️ Note:
- Do not scrape sunnah.com directly in runtime.  
- Instead, prepare a local JSON file with enough hadith (in correct sequence) for offline usage and smooth experience.
- Make sure Arabic text is `lang="ar"` and `dir="rtl"`.

Build the project in Replit so I can download it as a ZIP and load it directly into Chrome.
